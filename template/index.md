Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is a little test website/blog to document my random thoughts/experiments, both for your viewing/enjoyment, but also for me to look back on in the future. (his this is juni rlly sorry but i had to try hehe ~)

I'm a university student studying _nerd_ subjects, and have an interest in such.

I'm a datahoarder, with a 16TB storage server running on TrueNAS Scale.

I run a compute server which hosts [Pandora](posts/pandora/pandora.md), PiHole, a TailScale node, and occasionally minecraft servers.

I've also written a very basic, poorly implemented, [Rocket Flight Computer](https://github.com/Cubie87/L2RocketSoftware) using the Arduino IDE on a Teensy board to log data for a Tripoli Level 2 Certification Flight.
